 Consecutive Empty Boxes
===============

		Example 1:
		
		Table content: boxes
		
		id	is_empty
		1			1
		2			0
		3			1
		4			1
		5			1
		After running your SQL statement, the table should return:
		
		id
		3
		4
		5
		
		
		
		Example 2:
		
		Table content: boxes
		
		id	is_empty
		1			 1
		2			 0
		3			 1
		4			 1
		5			 0
		After running your SQL statement, the table should return:
		
		id
		3
		4
		
		
		There are some boxes marked with ID in one place, some of which are filled with things and some of which are free.
		Please write SQL statements, find empty and consecutive boxes, and return them in ascending order of id.
		
		Note: By saying consecutive, it refers to boxes near to each other are all empty, i.e.,
		the above or the one below is empty.
		
		
		Code:
				select id from boxes
				where is_empty = 1 and
				(
				    id+1 in (select id from boxes where is_empty = 1) -- the one below is empty
				    or
				    id-1 in (select id from boxes where is_empty = 1) --the above one is empty
				)
				order by id

Find a Classmate with the Same Name
===============
						id	name
						1		DaMing
						2		Amy
						3		HanMeimei
						4		Amy
						

		Write a SQL query to find all students with the same name in the students table.
		
		
		Code:
				select name from students
				group by name
				having count(name) > 1
		



===============
Members Whose Scores Exceed the Group leader
===============

		Given the group_members table, write a SQL query that can get the names of group members whose score exceeds their group leader (group_leader).
		
		
		
		Table content: group_members
		
		id	name		score			group_leader_id
		1		Bryant		81						4
		2		Iverson		860						1
		3		Carter		851						null
		4		McGrady		862						null
		
		In the above table, Bryant is the only group member whose score exceeds his group leader.
		
										name
										Bryant
		
		
		
		Code:
				select members.name
				from group_members members left join group_members leader
				on members.group_leader_id = leader.id
				where members.score > leader.score



===============
The height of the second tallest player
===============
		Write a SQL query to get the second tallest height in the players (height)
		
		Table content: players
		
		id	height
		1		 198
		2		 226
		3		 200
		4		 226
		For example, in the Table players above, the SQL query should return 200 as the second tallest height.
		If there is no second tallest height, then the query should return null
		
		second_height
		200
		
		
		
		Logic:
		Find the maximum height in the group of players whose height is smaller than the maximum height.

		Code:
				select max(height) as second_height from players where
				height < (select max(height) from players)
		
		
		
		
		
		





===============
Search for course information for courses with more students than the number of students in all courses of the oldest teacher
===============
Write an SQL statement that queries the student count of courses taught by the oldest teacher from the teacher table teachers and the course table courses, and finally returns the information of courses in which the number of students exceeds all those courses of the teacher.


Code:

		select * from courses where
		student_count > (
		    select max(student_count) from courses where 
		        teacher_id in (select id from teachers where age = (select max(age) from teachers))
		)
